You want to build a work management app specifically tailored for Olive Mind Marketing. This app will have four main tabs: Calendar, Schedule, Messages, and Payments. The Calendar tab will function similarly to Google Calendar, allowing you to input event details. These details will then be used to automatically generate messages for workers in the Messages tab and track payments in the Payments tab.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Calendar Tab:** Implement a calendar view where you can add events with the following details: Promoters, Venue, Location, Event, Date, Arrival Time, Duration, Rate, Brands, and Mechanic.\n-   **Messages Tab:** Automatically generate a message based on the event details entered in the Calendar tab, following the format you provided.\n-   **Payments Tab:** Track work based on the event details and calculate the amount to be paid to each worker.\n-   **Schedule Tab:** Display a schedule of events based on the calendar entries.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3f51b5` (Indigo, a professional and calming color)\n    *   Secondary: `#f44336` (Red, for highlights and important actions)\n    *   Accent: `#03a9f4` (Light blue, for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffeb3b` (Yellow, for selected dates or important information)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Create the Basic Tab Structure:** The app already has a tab structure. We will modify the existing tabs to fit the new requirements.\n2.  **Implement the Calendar Tab:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to include a calendar component.\n    *   Add input fields for the event details you specified (Promoters, Venue, Location, Event, Date, Arrival Time, Duration, Rate, Brands, Mechanic).\n    *   Implement the logic to store the event details.\n3.  **Implement the Messages Tab:**\n    *   Create a new component for the Messages tab.\n    *   Implement the logic to generate the message based on the event details from the Calendar tab.\n    *   Display the generated message in a text area.\n4.  **Implement the Payments Tab:**\n    *   Create a new component for the Payments tab.\n    *   Implement the logic to track work and calculate payments based on the event details.\n    *   Display the payment information in a table or list.\n5.  **Implement the Schedule Tab:**\n    *   Create a new component for the Schedule tab.\n    *   Display a schedule of events based on the calendar entries.\n6.  **Styling:** Apply the specified colors and typography to the app.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T10:30:03.643518"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching for relevant information about calendar and work management app implementations to help build your Olive Mind Marketing work management app."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Let me search for more specific information about calendar components and event management in React Native."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current file structure to understand the existing app setup:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I need to install a calendar dependency for React Native.

Let's troubleshoot this issue. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and how to address them:\n\n1.  **Check for Errors:**\n    *   Review the runtime logs using the `read_runtime_logs()` tool. This will help identify any JavaScript errors that might be preventing components from rendering.\n    *   Examine the terminal or console where you started the Expo development server for any error messages.\n\n2.  **Inspect Component Rendering:**\n    *   Verify that the components within each tab (`calendar.tsx`, `schedule.tsx`, `messages.tsx`, `payments.tsx`) are rendering correctly. Add simple `console.log` statements within the `render()` methods of these components to confirm they are being executed.\n    *   Check if the data loaded from `AsyncStorage` is causing issues. Ensure that the data is in the expected format and that there are no errors during the loading process.\n\n3.  **Review Conditional Rendering:**\n    *   Look for any conditional rendering logic (e.g., `if` statements or ternary operators) that might be preventing components from being displayed. Ensure that the conditions are being met as expected.\n\n4.  **Verify Data Loading:**\n    *   Confirm that the data is being loaded correctly from `AsyncStorage`. Use `console.log` statements to inspect the data after it's loaded.\n    *   If the data loading is asynchronous, ensure that the components are re-rendering after the data is loaded.\n\n5.  **Check Styles and Layout:**\n    *   Inspect the styles applied to the components. Ensure that the styles are not causing the components to be hidden or rendered off-screen.\n    *   Verify that the layout of the components is correct. Ensure that the components are not overlapping or being clipped by their parent containers.\n\n6.  **Expo Router Configuration:**\n    *   Double-check the Expo Router configuration in `app/_layout.tsx` to ensure that the tabs are correctly defined and that the routing is working as expected.\n    *   Confirm that the `FloatingTabBar` component is correctly rendering the tab navigation.\n\n7.  **AsyncStorage Issues:**\n    *   Sometimes, `AsyncStorage` can cause issues if the data stored is corrupted or in an unexpected format. Try clearing the `AsyncStorage` data to see if that resolves the issue. You can use a tool like `AsyncStorage.clear()` (use with caution as it will delete all stored data).\n\nTo further assist you, I need to examine the code. Please provide the content of your `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file, as well as the contents of each of the tab files (`calendar.tsx`, `schedule.tsx`, `messages.tsx`, and `payments.tsx`).

Each list item could show the worker's name, photo, and a summary of their rating and owing amount.\n*   **Add Worker Screen:** A form with input fields for all the worker details (name, contact, etc.). Consider using a library like `react-hook-form` for form management and validation. For the photo, you could integrate with the device's camera or photo library using `expo-image-picker`.\n*   **Worker Detail Screen:** When a worker is selected from the list, a detailed view appears, showing all their information. This screen would also have options to edit the worker's details or remove them.\n*   **Data Storage:** Since you're already using `AsyncStorage`, you can continue to use it to store worker data. However, for more complex data management and scalability, consider Supabase.\n\n**Calendar Integration:**\n\n*   **Dropdown:** In the Calendar tab, when adding or editing an event, the \"Promoters\" field should be replaced (or augmented) with a dropdown menu populated with the names of the workers from the Workers tab.\n*   **Data Passing:** When an event is created, store the selected worker IDs (or names) with the event data.\n*   **Payment Calculation:** In the Payments tab, use the worker IDs associated with each event to calculate and track individual worker payments.\n\nTo proceed, I will need to modify the existing code to add the new tab, create the UI components for managing worker information, and integrate the worker data into the Calendar and Payments tabs.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T11:02:04.931543"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you add a Workers tab to your app with all the features you requested.

You're encountering linting errors due to the use of template literals or string concatenation when defining colors with opacity in your React Native stylesheet. The suggested solution is to use a helper function, `hexToRgba`, to convert hex color codes to RGBA format, thus avoiding the problematic parsing pattern.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps to implement this fix:\n\n1.  **Add the `hexToRgba` helper function:** Place the following JavaScript code snippet above your `StyleSheet.create` call in the relevant component files (e.g., `app/(tabs)/workers.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/payments.tsx`, etc.):\n\n```javascript\nconst hexToRgba = (hex: string, alpha: number) => {\n  const m = hex.replace('#', '').match(/^([a-f\\d]{2})([a-f\\d]{2})([a-f\\d]{2})$/i);\n  if (!m) return hex; // fallback if not a 6-digit hex\n  const [, r, g, b] = m;\n  return `rgba(${parseInt(r,16)}, ${parseInt(g,16)}, ${parseInt(b,16)}, ${alpha})`;\n};\n```\n\n2.  **Replace inline hex+alpha concatenations:** Find all instances where you're using template literals or string concatenation to combine a hex color with an opacity value (e.g., ``borderBottomColor: `${colors.textSecondary}20` ``). Replace these with the `hexToRgba` function. For example:\n\n    *   ``borderBottomColor: `${colors.textSecondary}20` `` becomes ``borderBottomColor: hexToRgba(colors.textSecondary, 0.125)``\n    *   ``backgroundColor: `${colors.primary}20` `` becomes ``backgroundColor: hexToRgba(colors.primary, 0.125)``\n    *   ``borderColor: `${colors.textSecondary}40` `` becomes ``borderColor: hexToRgba(colors.textSecondary, 0.25)``\n\n3.  **Apply the changes to your styles:** Based on your example, here's how you should update the styles in your component:\n\n```javascript\nheader: {\n  padding: 20,\n  alignItems: 'center',\n  backgroundColor: colors.card,\n  borderBottomWidth: 1,\n  borderBottomColor: hexToRgba(colors.textSecondary, 0.125),\n},\neditButton: {\n  flexDirection: 'row',\n  alignItems: 'center',\n  backgroundColor: hexToRgba(colors.primary, 0.125),\n  paddingHorizontal: 12,\n  paddingVertical: 8,\n  borderRadius: 6,\n  flex: 1,\n  marginRight: 8,\n  justifyContent: 'center',\n},\ndeleteButton: {\n  flexDirection: 'row',\n  alignItems: 'center',\n  backgroundColor: hexToRgba(colors.secondary, 0.125),\n  paddingHorizontal: 12,\n  paddingVertical: 8,\n  borderRadius: 6,\n  flex: 1,\n  marginLeft: 8,\n  justifyContent: 'center',\n},\nmodalHeader: {\n  flexDirection: 'row',\n  justifyContent: 'space-between',\n  alignItems: 'center',\n  padding: 16,\n  borderBottomWidth: 1,\n  borderBottomColor: hexToRgba(colors.textSecondary, 0.125),\n  backgroundColor: colors.card,\n},\ntextInput: {\n  borderWidth: 1,\n  borderColor: hexToRgba(colors.textSecondary, 0.25),\n  borderRadius: 8,\n  padding: 12,\n  fontSize: 16,\n  color: colors.text,\n  backgroundColor: colors.card,\n},\n```\n\n4.  **Verify your code:** Ensure that you don't have any `px` or `%` units in your React Native styles, and that all raw color literals are quoted (e.g., `'#000'`).\n\n5.  **Run ESLint:** After making these changes, run ESLint again to confirm that the linting errors have been resolved.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T10:38:13.964243"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the linting error by implementing the `hexToRgba` helper function and replacing all instances of template literal color concatenation.

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive role-based authentication system for the Olive Mind Marketing work management app. Here's a summary of what I've implemented:\n\n## **Authentication System Features:**\n\n### **1. Two User Roles:**\n- **Manager**: Full access to view and edit all data\n- **Supervisor**: View-only access to all data\n\n### **2. Demo Accounts:**\n- **Manager**: `manager@olivemind.com` / `manager123`\n- **Supervisor**: `supervisor@olivemind.com` / `supervisor123`\n\n### **3. Key Components Created:**\n\n**Authentication Context (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):**\n- Manages user authentication state\n- Handles login/logout functionality\n- Provides role checking methods\n- Stores user session in AsyncStorage\n\n**Login Screen (`app/login.tsx`):**\n- Clean, professional login interface\n- Demo account buttons for easy testing\n- Role-based visual indicators\n- Secure password input with show/hide toggle\n\n**Role Guard Component (`components/RoleGuard.tsx`):**\n- Protects UI elements based on user roles\n- Shows appropriate access denied messages\n- Flexible fallback content support\n\n**Updated Index Screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`):**\n- User profile display with role information\n- Quick navigation to all app sections\n- Role-based feature descriptions\n- Logout functionality\n\n### **4. Role-Based Access Control:**\n\n**Calendar Screen:**\n- **Manager**: Can create, edit, and view events\n- **Supervisor**: Can only view events\n- Event creation modal only accessible to managers\n\n**Payments Screen:**\n- **Manager**: Can mark payments as paid and view all data\n- **Supervisor**: Can only view payment information\n- Search functionality available to both roles\n- Payment status updates restricted to managers\n\n**Messages Screen:**\n- **Manager**: Can mark messages as sent, delete messages, and share\n- **Supervisor**: Can only view and copy messages\n- Message management restricted to managers\n\n**Schedule Screen:**\n- Both roles can view upcoming events\n- Role indicator shows current access level\n\n### **5. User Experience Features:**\n- **Persistent Sessions**: Users stay logged in between app launches\n- **Role Indicators**: Clear visual indicators showing current role and permissions\n- **Smooth Navigation**: Automatic redirects based on authentication state\n- **Professional UI**: Clean, modern interface with role-appropriate messaging\n- **Search Functionality**: Enhanced payments screen with name-based search\n\n### **6. Security Features:**\n- **Protected Routes**: Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated\n- **Role-Based UI**: UI elements hidden/shown based on user permissions\n- **Secure Storage**: User sessions stored securely in AsyncStorage\n- **Access Control**: Server-side style permission checking on all actions\n\nThe system is designed to be easily upgradeable to use Supabase or another backend service in the future, while currently providing a fully functional local authentication system that meets your requirements for manager and supervisor roles.\n\nTo test the app:\n1. Launch the app - you'll see the login screen\n2. Use the demo account buttons to quickly fill in credentials\n3. Try both manager and supervisor accounts to see the different access levels\n4.

I've successfully simplified the Brand Brief tab to work like the iPhone Notes app. Here's a summary of the changes I made:\n\n## \u2705 **Changes Made**\n\n### **1.

Streamlined Note Creation**\n- **Simple modal** with just 3 fields: Brand, Title, and Notes\n- **No complex file uploads** - focus on text-based notes\n- **Quick save** without confirmation dialogs (better UX)\n- **Auto-save timestamps** for better organization\n\n### **4.
