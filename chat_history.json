You want to build a work management app specifically tailored for Olive Mind Marketing. This app will have four main tabs: Calendar, Schedule, Messages, and Payments. The Calendar tab will function similarly to Google Calendar, allowing you to input event details. These details will then be used to automatically generate messages for workers in the Messages tab and track payments in the Payments tab.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Calendar Tab:** Implement a calendar view where you can add events with the following details: Promoters, Venue, Location, Event, Date, Arrival Time, Duration, Rate, Brands, and Mechanic.\n-   **Messages Tab:** Automatically generate a message based on the event details entered in the Calendar tab, following the format you provided.\n-   **Payments Tab:** Track work based on the event details and calculate the amount to be paid to each worker.\n-   **Schedule Tab:** Display a schedule of events based on the calendar entries.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#3f51b5` (Indigo, a professional and calming color)\n    *   Secondary: `#f44336` (Red, for highlights and important actions)\n    *   Accent: `#03a9f4` (Light blue, for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffeb3b` (Yellow, for selected dates or important information)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Create the Basic Tab Structure:** The app already has a tab structure. We will modify the existing tabs to fit the new requirements.\n2.  **Implement the Calendar Tab:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to include a calendar component.\n    *   Add input fields for the event details you specified (Promoters, Venue, Location, Event, Date, Arrival Time, Duration, Rate, Brands, Mechanic).\n    *   Implement the logic to store the event details.\n3.  **Implement the Messages Tab:**\n    *   Create a new component for the Messages tab.\n    *   Implement the logic to generate the message based on the event details from the Calendar tab.\n    *   Display the generated message in a text area.\n4.  **Implement the Payments Tab:**\n    *   Create a new component for the Payments tab.\n    *   Implement the logic to track work and calculate payments based on the event details.\n    *   Display the payment information in a table or list.\n5.  **Implement the Schedule Tab:**\n    *   Create a new component for the Schedule tab.\n    *   Display a schedule of events based on the calendar entries.\n6.  **Styling:** Apply the specified colors and typography to the app.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T10:30:03.643518"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching for relevant information about calendar and work management app implementations to help build your Olive Mind Marketing work management app."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Let me search for more specific information about calendar components and event management in React Native."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current file structure to understand the existing app setup:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I need to install a calendar dependency for React Native.
